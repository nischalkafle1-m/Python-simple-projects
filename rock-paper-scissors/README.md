# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors Game

**My first Python project** - A console-based implementation of the classic game

## Features
- Player vs Computer gameplay
- Input validation (only accepts r/p/s)
- Clear win/lose/tie conditions
- Automatic game exit after result (no infinite loops)

## How to Run
```bash
python rps_game.py

#What I Learned:
-Basic Python syntax and control flow
-Working with dictionaries and random numbers
-User input validation
-Conditional game logic

#Future Improvements:
-Add score tracking(Best of 5)
-Create graphical using Pygame
-Add multiplayer functionality
